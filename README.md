 Based on hecomi's [UnityFurURP](https://github.com/hecomi/UnityFurURP).
 
 Containing three demo scenes:
 - High Fidelity
 - Performant
 - BakedLighting
 
 Please change the Project Quality from "HighFidelity" to "Performant" if opening "Performant" scene.

 Using Enlighten Realtime GI because I did not create a proper lightmapUV (which Progressive Lightmapper requires) for "PlushyToy" mesh.
