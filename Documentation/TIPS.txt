TIPS
=============

IMPORTANT
------------

Before customizing the fur, you should ensure the model has even UV(s).

evenly mapped UV:

unevenly mapped UV:


Performance Tips
------------

To keep an acceptable frame rate on wider range of devices, it is suggested to:

- Use the fewest shell layers while maintaining an acceptable appearance.

- Reduce Mesh (covered with fur) vertices while maintaining an acceptable appearance.

- Future work: It is possible to use two meshes separately. The one with fewer vertices can be used for fur generating.


Higher Fidelity Tips
------------

You may increase the maximum shell layers to improve fur quality. (52 shells -> more)
